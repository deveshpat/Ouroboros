## Curriculum Progress

| Stage | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — CoT warmup | ✅ COMPLETE | ce=0.4041, acc=0.0222 |
| 1 — 1 latent pass | ✅ COMPLETE | ce=0.4912, acc=0.0444 |
| 2 — 2 latent passes | ✅ COMPLETE | 6 rounds, A+B, ~36 906 samples |
| 3 — 3 latent passes | ✅ COMPLETE | 6 rounds; A solo r2–r3 (B only signals); C rejoined r5 |
| 4 — 4 latent passes | ✅ COMPLETE | 1 round, A+B+C all active |
| 5 — 5 latent passes | ✅ COMPLETE | 1 round, A+B+C all active |
| 6 — 6 latent passes | ✅ COMPLETE | 1 round, A+B+C all active |
| 7 — 7 latent passes | ✅ COMPLETE | 1 round, A+B+C all active |
| 8 — 8 latent passes | ✅ COMPLETE | Completed and superseded by stage 9/10 Hub state |
| 9 — 9 latent passes | ✅ COMPLETE | Stage 9 visible in W&B as complete before stage 10 dispatch |
| 10 — 10 latent passes | ✅ COMPLETE | Terminal DiLoCo and DGAC DiLoCo both reached 36,906/36,906 samples; latest anchor is the aggregated post-DGAC anchor |

**Compute mode:** DiLoCo dynamic workers with attendance/waiting-mode fallback; Azure H100 is available for budget-bounded sequential DGAC checkpoints when Kaggle quota is the bottleneck.
**Current gate:** Correctness-aware DGAC checkpoint `runs/azure_h100_dgac/stage_10/checkpoint-0001154` was promoted to canonical `diloco_state/anchor` at `2026-05-15T11:24:25+00:00` from source revision `374a9a32d81242224465b786d62aaef7564639e6`, with `mark_dgac_complete=true` and `total_train_samples=36906`. It is **not** a final quality gate yet: val/gen were skipped during the Azure run. Next action is post-promotion anchor eval/gen via `dgac-anchor-eval`; coordinator cron must not dispatch stage 11.

## Engineering Architecture Status

| Track | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Training monolith extraction | ✅ COMPLETE | `python -m ouroboros.coconut` is the package-owned training entrypoint; Coconut owns CLI, stage, DGAC, latent, checkpoint, evaluation hooks, and session seams. |
| Kaggle launch seam | ✅ COMPLETE | `ouroboros.coordinator.kaggle_launch_matrix` owns launch-mode behavior; notebook remains a thin shell-magic adapter and no longer duplicates `torchrun` argv. |
| Runtime signal tracking cleanup | ✅ COMPLETE | Generated `signals/*.json` files are ignored; only `signals/.gitkeep` belongs in source control; the signal mechanism remains active as the coordinator doorbell. |
| Coordinator zero-drift extraction | ✅ COMPLETE | `python -m ouroboros.coordinator` is the package-owned orchestration entrypoint; aggregation, state, dispatch, worker, launch, promotion, and repair seams live under `ouroboros.coordinator.*`. |
| Planning artifact retirement | ✅ COMPLETE | Completed PRDs/plans have been promoted into wiki documentation and removed from `prds/` and `plans/`. |
| Kaggle CPU/API workflow validation | ✅ COMPLETE | Eval-owned CPU smoke mode, repo/runtime seams, CPU metadata dispatch, fake coordinator loop tests, manual API validation docs, and remote Hub artifact verification are in place. |
| Seven-package runtime reliability | ✅ COMPLETE | Added pure seams for coordinator decisions, Kaggle launch contracts/matrix, training session plans, worker lifecycle classification, runtime env aliases, Kaggle runtime, and latent execution; latest chunked local CPU regression coverage passed `158` tests. |
| DGAC readiness CPU-smoke gate | ✅ PASSED LIVE | GitHub Actions `coordinate #272` ran `workflow_validate=cpu-smoke`, defaulted to Worker A, pushed Kaggle kernel version 39, Kaggle exited before `torchrun`, published Hub artifacts, and coordinator verified validation run `25377312407-1`. |
| JEPA-style latent prediction / multimodal Ouroboros | 🧊 DEFERRED | Direction documented in [Future-JEPA-Multimodal-Latent](Future-JEPA-Multimodal-Latent.md). No code changes until DGAC, evaluation, benchmarking, and core correctness gates are stable. |

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Quality-check the promoted canonical DGAC anchor** — use GitHub Actions → `coordinate` with `kaggle_run_mode=dgac-anchor-eval`, `force_worker_ids=A`, `skip_trigger=false`, `dry_run=false`, and empty `workflow_validate`; leave `dgac_anchor_eval_resume_mode=full` for a fresh eval, or use `dgac_anchor_eval_resume_mode=diagnostics-only` plus `dgac_diagnostics_forced_kmax_ce=<known CE>` to resume only the DGAC diagnostics after a completed base validation. Trust the result only if logs include `Loaded halt gate from diloco_state/anchor/halt_gate.pt`.
2. **Compare against the Azure checkpoint only if needed** — direct checkpoint eval of `runs/azure_h100_dgac/stage_10/checkpoint-0001154` is now optional forensic validation, because that checkpoint has already been copied into `diloco_state/anchor`. Do not use `--resume_from_diloco_anchor` for raw checkpoint eval.
3. **Resume remaining H100 DGAC epochs only if anchor eval is mixed/bad** — continue from `checkpoint-0001154` with `--use_halt_gate` + the normal checkpoint resume path, `--hf_stage_subdir runs/azure_h100_dgac`, and no `--resume_from_diloco_anchor`. Lower `--val_skip_buffer_minutes` if validation/generation must run before timeout, then promote again only after reviewing eval/gen evidence.
4. **Review DGAC research signal** — inspect HaltGate behavior / halt-step distribution and compare post-DGAC `val_ce`, `val_acc`, and generations against the terminal anchor baseline. `pct_at_1≈1.0` is acceptable only if forced-`k1` CE is near forced-full CE.
5. **Decide next branch** — if val/gen/halt distribution is good, move to benchmark + packaging PRD; if mixed, run another corrected DGAC pass from the best checkpoint/anchor; if bad, rollback or inspect DGAC loss/instrumentation.

## Latest Validation Evidence

| Gate | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Stage 10 terminal aggregation | ✅ PASS | 2026-05-09 coordinator run read `stage=10 round=2`, found A/B/C ready, aggregated 3 workers on CPU, logged `samples_this_round=25994`, `total_samples_stage=36906`, `pct_stage_done=100`, and printed `Stage 10 COMPLETE ... Entering DGAC manual gate.` |
| Stage 11 dispatch prevention | ✅ PASS | Same run printed `Stage 10 is terminal for DiLoCo` and `Done (DGAC manual gate)` after uploading the stage 10 round 2 anchor. |
| Stage 10 terminal anchor eval-only | ✅ PASS | 2026-05-09 eval loaded `diloco_state/anchor`, reported `val_ce=0.4863`, `val_acc=0.0889`, coherent generation samples for arithmetic/code/factual/explanatory prompts, and `Mean UWR=0.733`; `k_actual=10` is expected before DGAC because HaltGate starts zero-init. |
| GitHub Actions → Kaggle API dispatch | ✅ PASS | `coordinate #272`, `workflow_validate=cpu-smoke`, Worker A default, Kaggle kernel version 39 pushed |
| Kaggle CPU validation branch | ✅ PASS | Notebook printed `[workflow-validate] CPU smoke validation complete`; exited with `SystemExit: 0` before `torchrun` |
| Remote Hub validation artifact | ✅ PASS | `diloco_state/workflow_validation/25377312407-1/worker_A_status.json` and `worker_A_report.json` published |
| Coordinator artifact verification | ✅ PASS | Coordinator printed `CPU-smoke validation verified via remote Hub artifacts: ['A']` |
| GPU/training-state safety | ✅ PASS | Report shows `gpu_requested=false`, `torchrun_requested=false`, `published=true`; status path stayed under `local_validation/...` |
| Seven-package runtime regression suite | ✅ PASS | Latest chunked local CPU validation across all 24 test files: `36 passed`, `84 passed`, `38 passed` → `158 passed` total |
| Training/runtime/launch/latent deep-module regression suite | ✅ PASS | Current post-RFC chunked coverage: all 24 test files, `158 passed` total. Single `pytest -q` can still time out locally before final summary, so chunked validation remains the reported local gate. |
| Kaggle launch + DGAC canary preflight slice | ✅ PASS | Targeted launch/notebook/deep-module/source-of-truth/DGAC halt-supervision gate passed locally: `57 passed`; `dgac-canary --dry_run` exits before Hub/Kaggle mutation. |
| Azure H100 corrected DGAC epoch 0 | ✅ CHECKPOINTED | Run `Azure H100 SCUS DGAC full budgeted` loaded `diloco_state/anchor` plus `halt_gate.pt`, verified H100 BF16/flash-attn/Mamba fast path, completed epoch 0 at stage 10, saved `runs/azure_h100_dgac/stage_10/checkpoint-0001154`, and uploaded `training_state.pt`, adapter weights, and `halt_gate.pt`; val/gen skipped due to the 720 min validation buffer. |
| Azure DGAC checkpoint promotion | ✅ PROMOTED / 🟡 QUALITY PENDING | Promotion at `2026-05-15T11:24:25+00:00` copied adapter weights/config plus `halt_gate.pt` from `runs/azure_h100_dgac/stage_10/checkpoint-0001154` into `diloco_state/anchor`, marked DGAC complete, and recorded `total_train_samples=36906`; post-promotion anchor eval/gen is still pending. |

| Worker quota for DiLoCo stage 10 | ✅ No longer blocking — final A/B/C round aggregated on 2026-05-09 |
| Stage 10 terminal anchor quality gate | ✅ Passed — `val_ce=0.4863`, `val_acc=0.0889`, coherent generation, `Mean UWR=0.733` |
| CPU-smoke end-to-end workflow gate before DGAC? | 🟢 Passed live — GitHub Actions `coordinate #272`, validation run `25377312407-1`, Worker A, Hub status/report verified |
| JEPA-style latent prediction / multimodal output direction? | 🧊 Deferred — document only for now; future PRD should start with text-only Reasoning-JEPA v1 after DGAC evaluation |
