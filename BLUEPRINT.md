## Part 0 — Quick-Resume Context

### What this project is
Coconut-Ouroboros: latent reasoning injection into Jamba Reasoning 3B (Transformer-Mamba hybrid). The Mamba SSM recurrent state acts as compressed scratch-pad across K latent thought passes, replacing token generation during reasoning. Based on Meta's Coconut (arXiv:2412.06769), extended with DGAC (Diversity-Gated Adaptive Coconut) — a novel anti-collapse halt gate.

### Current Status (2026-05-02)

| Curriculum Stage | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Stage 0 — CoT warmup | ✅ COMPLETE | ce=0.4041, acc=0.0222 |
| Stage 1 — 1 latent pass | ✅ COMPLETE | ce=0.4912, acc=0.0444 |
| Stage 2 — 2 latent passes | ✅ COMPLETE | 6 rounds, A+B, ~36,906 samples |
| Stage 3 — 3 latent passes | ✅ COMPLETE | 6 rounds; A solo r2–r3 (B only signals); C rejoined r5 |
| Stage 4 — 4 latent passes | ✅ COMPLETE | 1 round, A+B+C all active |
| Stage 5 — 5 latent passes | ✅ COMPLETE | 1 round, A+B+C all active |
| Stage 6 — 6 latent passes | ✅ COMPLETE | 1 round, A+B+C all active |
| Stage 7 — 7 latent passes | ✅ COMPLETE | 1 round, A+B+C all active (coordinator aggregation pending) |
| Stage 8 — 8 latent passes | 🔄 IN PROGRESS | Coordinator will dispatch on next run (≤30 min) |
| Stages 9–10 | ⬜ NOT STARTED | — |

**Compute mode: DiLoCo 3-worker (A+B+C all active, 1 round per stage since stage 4.)**

**Training velocity:** ~1 stage/day for stages 4–7. Stages 8–10 expected to complete ~2026-05-04.

---

## Part 0.1 — Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1 — Monitor stages 8–10 (no action required)
Stage 7 round 0 complete for all three workers (signals present). Coordinator will aggregate and dispatch stage 8 automatically. No code changes needed.

### Step 2 — Watch W&B pre-val accuracy trend
Pre-val accuracy at stage entry (Worker A round 0):
- Stage 3: 0.00% → Stage 4: ~2% → Stage 5: ~3–4% → Stage 6: ~4–6% → Stage 7: ~6–8% (expected)
- Target by Stage 10: define success threshold before DGAC (see Part 4, open question)

### Step 3 — DGAC prep: fix anchor handoff **[REQUIRED BEFORE PHASE 3.4]**
⚠️ **Architecture gap identified:** `--use_halt_gate` cannot load DiLoCo-trained weights.
The current code's `find_latest_resume_checkpoint()` scans for `training_state.pt` in
`runs/stage3_curriculum/` — DiLoCo mode never writes there. The final anchor lives at
`diloco_state/anchor/` on Hub.

**Fix required:** Add `--resume_from_diloco_anchor` flag to `jamba_coconut_finetune.py`.
See coding-agent prompt: `prompts/fix_dgac_anchor_handoff.md`

**DGAC launch command (after fix):**
```bash
python jamba_coconut_finetune.py \
  --use_halt_gate \
  --resume_from_diloco_anchor \
  --diloco_state_repo WeirdRunner/Ouroboros \
  --hf_token "$HF_TOKEN" \
  --data_dir data/coconut_v1 --use_4bit \
  --epochs_per_stage 3 \
  --max_stage 10 \
  --session_timeout_hours 12.0 \
  --output_dir runs/stage3_dgac \
  --wandb_project "ouroboros-stage3-jamba"
```

### Step 4 — Stage 3 rounds 2–3: A signal gap (low priority)
Worker A has no signal files for stage 3 rounds 2 and 3. B completed both. Coordinator handled correctly (solo/attendance mode). Flag for W&B review.

| val accuracy samples | 50 |
| `--val_skip_buffer_minutes` | 60 |
| NCCL timeout | `timedelta(hours=4)` |
| `--epochs_per_stage` | 1 |
| `--batch_size` | 4 (2 per GPU on Dual T4) |
| amp_dtype T4 (sm75) | FP16 |
| amp_dtype A100+ (sm80+) | BF16 |
| Gradient checkpointing | Auto-disabled at VRAM≥40GB |
| Multi-account strategy | DiLoCo dynamic parallel |
| Notebook launch cells | `!torchrun` magic commands only |
| Worker auto-detection | `DILOCO_WORKER_ID` Kaggle secret per account (`A`/`B`/`C`) |
| Kaggle trigger auth | Per-worker credentials; owner-authenticated |
| **Kaggle trigger mechanism** | Local `kernels push`: stage checked-in `kaggle-utils.ipynb` + generated `kernel-metadata.json` → `kaggle kernels push -p <tmpdir>`. No pull needed. ✅ |
| **Kaggle SDK version** | **`kaggle>=1.8.4`** — first version with `--accelerator` for `kernels push` (PR #907). ✅ VERIFIED WORKING |
| **`"accelerator"` field in kernel-metadata.json** | **`"NvidiaTeslaT4"` (capital N).** Belt-and-suspenders alongside `--accelerator` CLI flag. ✅ |
| **`"accelerator"` CLI flag in push command** | **`--accelerator NvidiaTeslaT4`** added to `push_args` in `_trigger_single_worker()`. ✅ VERIFIED WORKING |
| **GPU fast-fail safety net** | `cc < (7,5)` → `_diloco_reset_triggered_at()` + signal + `sys.exit(0)`. ✅ DEPLOYED |
| W&B worker run ID | `diloco-{worker_lower}-s{stage_k}-r{round_n}` — unique per round |
| W&B worker group | `diloco-{worker_lower}-s{stage_k}` — groups all rounds for a stage |
| W&B coordinator run ID | `diloco-coordinator-s{stage_k}` |
| W&B step axis | Monotonic: `round_n × (shard_step_estimate + 1) + local_step` ✅ |

| DiLoCo outer LR | 0.7 (diloco mode) / 1.0 effective (solo mode = direct promotion) |
| **`min_shard_samples`** | **32** (1 optimizer step = batch_size × grad_accum) |
| **Solo mode** | 1 active worker → direct weight promotion (skip outer update). |
| **Stage close** | remaining < `min_shard_samples` per active worker → declare stage complete, advance. |
| **`workflow_dispatch` inputs** | `force_worker_ids`, `skip_trigger`, `dry_run`. Full control from Actions UI. |
| **Worker timeout threshold** | **13h** (Kaggle 12h hard wall + 1h grace). Set via `--worker_timeout_hours`. |
| **`triggered_at` field** | Written to `round_state.json` on every worker dispatch. Reset to 0 as "unconfirmed dispatch" signal. |
| **`triggered_at=0` semantics** | Canonical signal for "dispatch unconfirmed". Coordinator immediately re-dispatches on next run. ✅ VERIFIED |
| **Attendance round** | Worker in `attendance_workers` → skips training, uploads status(samples=0), pushes signal. |
| **Waiting mode** | All credentialed workers in `attendance_workers`. `round_n` frozen. |
| **Stages 4–7 structure** | 1 round each (3 workers × 12,302 samples = 36,906 = full stage). Stage complete after round 0. |
| **DGAC base weights** | Loaded from `diloco_state/anchor/` via `--resume_from_diloco_anchor` (fix pending). |

---

## Part 0.5 — Pre-flight Blockers

| Blocker | Resolution |

| W&B step collision between rounds | `round_step_span = shard_step_estimate + 1` ✅ |
| `kaggle kernels pull` → 403 | Replaced with local `kernels push` ✅ |
| `kaggle==2.0.x` gRPC → 403 | Pinned `kaggle==1.6.17` ✅ (now superseded by `>=1.8.4`) |
| `kaggle kernels push --accelerator` → unrecognized arg | Removed CLI flag; GPU requested via JSON metadata ✅ (belt-and-suspenders: also added CLI flag after upgrade to >=1.8.4) |
| Coordinator stalls on quota-dead worker | `triggered_at` + 13h timeout → attendance mechanism ✅ |
| Round 1 deadlock (triggered_at≠0, workers never ran) | `triggered_at=0` manual reset → immediate re-dispatch ✅ VERIFIED (Session 19) |
| **`kaggle==1.6.17` predates `--accelerator` feature → P100 assigned** | **Fixed: `kaggle>=1.8.4` + `--accelerator NvidiaTeslaT4` in `push_args` + `"NvidiaTeslaT4"` JSON cap + runtime fast-fail. ✅ VERIFIED WORKING (no P100 since deploy)** |
| **W&B subsequent rounds not logged (wandb 0.25.0 resume bug)** | **Per-round run IDs + `group=` parameter. ✅ VERIFIED WORKING (dashboard shows separate runs per round)** |
| Worker C quota exhausted (stages 2–3 early rounds) | Quota renewed; C rejoined at stage 3 round 5. All three workers active from stage 4 onward. ✅ |
| **DGAC base weights: `--use_halt_gate` cannot find DiLoCo anchor** | **Fix pending: `--resume_from_diloco_anchor` flag. See `prompts/fix_dgac_anchor_handoff.md`** |

## Part 1 — Architecture

### Jamba Reasoning 3B
```
HuggingFace : ai21labs/AI21-Jamba-Reasoning-3B   License: Apache 2.0
Layers      : 28 (26 Mamba + 2 Attention) — 13:1 ratio
d_model     : 2560
Trainable   : 26,851,328 params (0.88% — LoRA adapters only)
```

### Coconut Curriculum
```
Stage 0:  [Q][S1..Sn][A]              standard CoT; labels on all steps + A
Stage k:  [Q][●*k][S_{k+1}..Sn][A]   first k steps → latent; labels shift right
Stage K:  [Q][●*K][A]                 all steps replaced; labels on A only
K = 10
```

### Dynamic DiLoCo Protocol
```
Each round:
  Coordinator
    1. remaining = total_train - total_samples_seen[stage_k]
    2. if remaining < min_shard_samples (per active worker) → advance stage
    3. projected_shard[w] = _partition_contiguous_range(remaining, 3, w_idx)
    4. active = [w for w if projected_shard[w] >= min_shard_samples AND w has creds AND w not in attendance_workers]
    5. mode = "complete"|"solo"|"diloco"|"waiting"
    6. Aggregate previous round (solo → direct promotion, diloco → weighted avg)
    7. Trigger active workers (training) + attendance_workers (ping-only)
    8. Write round_state.json with triggered_workers, attendance_workers, mode, triggered_at

  Workers (triggered subset)
    - GPU guard: if sm60 (P100) → reset triggered_at=0 + push signal + exit
    - If in attendance_workers → download anchor, upload status(samples=0), push signal, return
    - Else → train on shard, upload weights + status, push signal

  Timeout (coordinator, next run after 13h)
    - Non-responsive triggered workers → demote to attendance_workers
    - All in attendance → mode = "waiting", round_n frozen
```

### DGAC (Phase 3.4 only)
```
L_total = L_ce + λ₁(t)·L_ponder + λ₂·L_diversity
HaltGate: Linear(2·d_model → 1), zero-init
Base weights: loaded from diloco_state/anchor/ via --resume_from_diloco_anchor
```

---

## Part 2 — Performance Model

```
Stage 1: ~41s/step  Stage 2: ~48–53s/step  Stage 3: ~69s/step
Stage 5: ~92s/step  Stage 10: ~149s/step (estimated)
Observed velocity (stages 4–7): ~1 stage/day with 3 workers on 12h Kaggle sessions
Stages 8–10 ETA: ~2026-05-04 (3 stages × 1 day, all 3 workers active)
```

## Part 4 — Open Questions

| Question | Status |
|---|---|
| Stage 2 DiLoCo: does aggregated model match sequential baseline? | 🟡 Pre-val acc rising monotonically (0%→2%→4%→6%+) — promising signal |
| Stage 3 rounds 2–3: where are Worker A signals? | 🟡 Likely solo/attendance — B signals present, coordinator handled correctly |
| TRC GPU quota conversion | 🟡 Email sent — awaiting response |
| DGAC halt_step distribution at K≥2 | 🔴 Open — primary research question (Phase 3.4, starts after stage 10) |
| Worker C quota: stable for remainder of curriculum? | 🟢 Active since stage 3 round 5 — appears stable |
| Pre-val accuracy at stage 10: target threshold for DGAC? | 🔴 Open — define success criteria before Phase 3.4 |

---

## Part 5 — Hard Lessons

| Lesson | Fix |
|---|---|
| `kaggle kernels pull` → 403 in CI | Use local `kernels push` instead |
| W&B step collision between rounds | `round_step_span = shard_step_estimate + 1` |
| Fixed `min_workers` causes deadlock when B has empty shard | Dynamic `min_shard_samples` pre-computation |
| Stage never closes with geometric remainder | `remaining < min_shard_samples` → declare stage complete |
| Coordinator triggers all workers even when some have nothing to do | Pre-compute projected shards, trigger only active workers |
| Solo mode with outer_lr=0.7 blends stale anchor into new weights | Direct weight promotion in solo mode |
| `kaggle kernels push --accelerator` → unrecognized argument (old CLI) | Upgrade to `kaggle>=1.8.4`; add `--accelerator NvidiaTeslaT4` to `push_args` |
| Worker C quota exhausted → coordinator stalls forever | `triggered_at` + 13h timeout + attendance mechanism |
| Coordinator writes `triggered_workers` but push fails silently | `triggered_at=0` manual reset → immediate re-dispatch on next run |
| `kaggle==1.6.17` + `enable_gpu:true` + `"accelerator": "nvidiaTeslaT4"` → still P100 | Root cause 1: `--accelerator` CLI flag added in v1.8.4 (predates our pin). Root cause 2: wrong cap. Fix: `kaggle>=1.8.4` + `--accelerator NvidiaTeslaT4` + fix JSON cap + runtime fast-fail. All verified. |
| `wandb==0.25.0` `resume="allow"` on finished run creates ephemeral run | Per-round run IDs + `group=` for stage-level grouping |
| W&B dashboard becomes unreadable with many overlapping runs | Unique `id` per round + `group` by stage keeps it navigable |
| **`--use_halt_gate` starts from random LoRA weights (DiLoCo path)** | **`--resume_from_diloco_anchor` loads `diloco_state/anchor/` before DGAC training (fix pending)** |
